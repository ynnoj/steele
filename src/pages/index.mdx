# Hey, I'm Jonathan

I'm a web developer working with JavaScript and Node.js. I'm an avid learner, keen to explore and understand emerging libraries and web technologies.

Right now I'm into at [Gatsby](https://gatsbyjs.org), [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) and serverless architecture via the [Zeit Now](https://zeit.co/now) platform.

Currently at [GraphCMS](https://graphcms.com).
